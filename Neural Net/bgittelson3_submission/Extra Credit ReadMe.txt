I’ve included a method called getBalanceData (not buildExamplesFromExtraData—sorry!) in my NeuralNetUtil.py file that retrieves the Balance data from the .txt file, changes the encoding to one-hot, creates the list of examples, and splits it into training and testing sets. I’ve included the dataset as a .txt file (balance-data.txt), but it’s also available here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Balance+Scale.
